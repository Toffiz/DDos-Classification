# 🛡️ DDoS Attack Classification using Graph Neural Networks (GNN)

This project focuses on detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using Graph Neural Networks. We build communication graphs from network flow data and apply a GCN-based model to classify traffic as benign or malicious.

## 📥 Data Setup

Before running the notebook, you must download the dataset and place it into the `data/` folder. The dataset should contain `.csv` files for each attack type (e.g., `BENIGN.csv`, `SYN.csv`).

You can use any modern DDoS dataset, such as [CIC-DDoS2019](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html).

## 🧠 Model Overview

- **Graph Construction**: Communication flows are converted into a graph format using source/destination IPs.
- **Features**: Numerical flow statistics + injected synthetic noise for robustness.
- **GNN Architecture**: Two-layer GCN (Graph Convolutional Network)
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio torch-geometric pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn networkx
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Download and extract dataset into `data/`.
2. Open `final.ipynb` and run all cells.
3. Train/test the GCN classifier and visualize results.

## 📊 Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix

## 🖼️ Visuals

Graphs and embeddings are visualized using PCA and Seaborn.

## 📌 Notes

- The graph is built from flow-level features using IP addresses as nodes.
- Synthetic DDoS traffic is generated by modifying real attack traffic with noise injection.
- Designed for research and educational purposes.
